### README for Vertebral Column Dataset

---

#### Overview

The Vertebral Column dataset contains biomechanical features of the vertebral column that were used to classify patients into three categories: normal, disk hernia or spondilolysthesis. The dataset was visualized using common ML visualization tools.

#### Project Rationale

**Importance of Visualizing Healthcare Data with Machine Learning:**

1. **Improved Diagnosis and Treatment Planning**: Machine learning models can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and planning treatment by identifying patterns in complex datasets. Visualization of these patterns can enhance understanding and decision-making.

2. **Early Detection**: By analyzing biomechanical features, ML models can help in the early detection of spinal abnormalities, allowing for timely intervention and better patient outcomes.

3. **Patient Stratification**: Visualizing data can help in categorizing patients into different risk groups, leading to personalized treatment plans and more efficient resource allocation.

4. **Research and Development**: Visual tools help researchers understand the underlying relationships between features, fostering innovation and the development of new treatment protocols.
